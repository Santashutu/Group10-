**1: Using wxPython**
wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit you can use to create functional GUIs in a simple and easy manner. The implementation is a set of Python extension modules that wrap the GUI components of the wxWidgets cross-platform library, which is written in C++. wxPython creates native user interfaces that add zero additional overhead to the application, giving the user the capabilities of a functional library without necessarily having a burden.

   ** Advantages**
    - Cross-platform
    - Open source
    - Simple to use
    - Easily installed using pip
   ** Disdvantage**
    - Not pre-installed on Python
    
    **Java Code to Check Nested Brackets**
